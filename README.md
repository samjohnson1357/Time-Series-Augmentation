# Time-Series-Augmentation

In this project we augment time series data through deep learning techniques to improve eventual classification accuracy.

I recommend reading the included research paper, "Time_Series_Augmentation_through_Deep_Learning.pdf" to understand the research results.

Read the code to understand the implementation that led to the results in the paper.
